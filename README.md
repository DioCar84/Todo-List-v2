## Introduction

This is a basic todo-list which allows you to add items, delete items and create new lists.
To create a new list, simply type the name of the list as the last word in the url.
In order to delete the starting list items please add an item before deleting all entries.

## What I used

### Front-end: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS

### Back-end: 
Node.js, Express.js

### Database: 
MongoDB

### Other: 
Lodash, Mongoose

## What I learned

This project was a fun challenge and reinforced my Javascript knowledge plus I learned about EJS and MongoDB. 
The goal was to create an interactive todo-list which allows the user basic create/delete commands.
This app is connected to a MongoDB database which allows for CRUD implementation.
